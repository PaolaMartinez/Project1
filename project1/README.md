# Project 1

This project is a webpage where you are able to find books that are available in the GoodReads page, and make your own reviews on the chosen ones. You can also know what are the ratings in this other website.

Now there is a description of what is contained in each file:

* 404.html: Just an error message.
* books.html: It is the Book page where you can see the details of the book chosen in the previous page, which is "search.html". In this page you can also see any reviews that other users have left for the book on the website, and also you can submit your own review. Another thing that can be found in this page is the average rating and number of ratings of the book from Goodreads page.
* form.html: Initial form for registering.
* index.html: First thing that appears where you can log in, or click to go to the registration page.
* review.html: Page where you can write the review of the book you have chosen (books.html leads you to this page if you choose to add a new review or to update a previous version).
* search.html: After you log in, this page is showed, where you can search for a book by title, author or isbn. The search is capital sensitive.
* success.html: Page showed after a correct registration. You can then press the log in button.
* create.sql: SQL queries to create the tables used in this project.
